To get the benchtop test running, the first thing you are going to need to do is flash the Rio

Use the rio tool to format the RIO.
Then, begin making the benchtop test run with secure the motor(s) to the board. You may use either one or two motors.
- Plug the motor(s) into the PWM slots (We will work on CAN later)
- Use either a USB cable or ethernet to connect directly to the Rio
- Open VSCode (be certain to use the 2022 Beta)
- Create a new project using the Benchtop test template
- Change the motor ports to match the ones you actually used
- Deploy it
- Enable the robot
- Did work? If so, Proceed to adding a Radio or Using the motors via CAN
